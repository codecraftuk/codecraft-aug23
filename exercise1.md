Receiving a Pallet
==================

A Warehouse receives pallets on lorries.

When a pallet arrives, the team finds the corresponding purchase order and
checks off the items, the pallet is refused if the purchase order and items
don't tally.

Then the items are put away into bins.

For each item on the pallet (a pallet can contain many different types of
items), the team looks for:

- a "not yet full" bin of those items (identifiable by "Stock Keeping Unit" - SKU).
- an empty bin

The items are then put into the bin that was identified for storing them.
